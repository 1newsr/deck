# Compatibility promise

decK's compatibility guranteess are:

- The state file generated by decK will remain forward compatible for each
major version series (1.x, 2.x, etc). This means that a state file generated by
version 1.x of decK will remain compatible with every version 1.y, where y > x.
- decK's CLI commands and flags will remain forward compatible for each major
version series.

API of decK's Go code will change as developement progresses. decK's exported
Go packages, functions, interfaces, data-structures are not part of the
compatibility promise.
